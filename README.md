# courseManagement
The solution of the tutorial for "Building Isomorphic Apps with Meteor JS".

# How to get started
This is how to get started on Ubuntu / Debian systems (it has also been covered in the tutorial slides).
However, Meteor also supports other linux distributions, OS X, and since the latest release 1.1 also Windows!

Everything you have to do is to make the file initialSetup.sh executable ("chmod +x initialSetup.sh") and run it.
This script will install the IDE "Geany", Meteor, JDK 8, Android SDK, and git for you.
